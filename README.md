# 🧪 JupyterNotebooks

Welcome 😉

Here I collect and share my Python projects, mostly built with Jupyter Notebooks.  
Whether it’s quick data analysis, playing around with ML, or just trying out some packages.

## 📦 Environment Management

I'm using **Miniconda** to manage environments.

### ▶️ How to install Miniconda (on Windows)

1. Open Terminal (e.g. PowerShell)
2. Download the installer:

   ```powershell
   wget "https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Windows-x86_64.exe" -OutFile ".\Downloads\Miniconda3-latest-Windows-x86_64.exe"   
3. ADD PATH and ignore the HINT
